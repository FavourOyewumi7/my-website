            <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                If you're looking for someone to analyze your data, I am the perfect candidate.
                 I have a strong proficiency in Python, SQL, Power BI, and I can use these tools 
                 to uncover insights that will amaze you. Let me help you make sense of your data 
                 and turn it into actionable information.

            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                As demonstrated by the projects listed above, my participation in ML hackathons in the past
                 and my certificate from the prestigious DSN [Data Science Nigeria] have given me an advantage 
                 in my understanding of machine learning, from tabular data to Convolutional Neural Networks. Send
                me a message so we can talk more.

            <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
            <p>
                By participating in challenging platforms like Leetcode and Hackerrank, and solving over 350 questions across both platforms, 
                I have developed the ability to think critically and find the most efficient solutions to problems, in terms of both space and 
                time complexity. If you're interested in discussing problem-solving strategies, feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy 
                to chat with you.
