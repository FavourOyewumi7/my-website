          I am currently a student of the University of Lagos studying Applied Physics[Electronics Option]. 
          I have lots of interest in Front-End Web development, regularly increasing my spectrum of knowledge 
          of technologies used in this area. I also love to deal with robots and interacting with them, this 
          love has made me pick up an intersts in python, which I use to write Machine Learning code to be able 
          to predict actions based on past data. You may ask, why is someone who is interested in Computer Science
          studying Physics?, Well, personally I love to learn about the way the universe works and all the teeny, 
          weeny details about everything going on. I also happen to love photography, cause it gives me an avenue 
          to appreciate the environment around me and also capture/document priceless moments that are to be cherished 
          forever. Other side attractions about me is that I am an instrumentalist(I play drums 😁) and love to read 
          and sleep 🤷🏿‍♂️
